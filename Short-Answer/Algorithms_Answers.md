#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n^2)

b)O(n log n)
first line is constant
for loop is linear
while loop is logarithmic
When i take away the constants from O(1 + n + log(n)) im left with O(n log n)

c)O(n)
The function is dependent of how many bunnies there are
